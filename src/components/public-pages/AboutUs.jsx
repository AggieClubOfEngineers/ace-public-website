          &nbsp; &nbsp; The Aggie Club of Engineers started with a handful of
          guys, looking to start something bigger than themselves. They had
          worked through their first challenging years of engineering all while
          being involved in some of the best fraternities and professional
          organizations A&M has to offer. They were, by all stretches of the
          word, successful. But they had realized one thing. For all the
          prestige their organizations boasted, they just didn't bring engineers
          together inside and outside of the classroom. They needed something
          different.
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Nine years later, ACE stands as an homage to our
          founders' vision. We have joined the ranks of some of the premier
          men's organizations on campus, but with a flavor all our own. We have
          cultivated a culture that allows our members to develop in academics
          and leadership, while offering the highest caliber professional
          opportunities and social events. This is made possible by the amazing
          diversity in our organization. Our members represent over a dozen
          countries and come from every engineering discipline at Texas A&M. We
          have Student Senators, Fish Camp Counselors, Muster Committee members,
          Executives at fraternities and professional organizations, and members
          of the Student Engineering Council. Each one of us br/ings a unique
          experience and background and puts it toward one common goal: To
          create a place for leaders to thrive.
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I cannot overstate the impact ACE has had in
          developing me through college. It has given me friendships and
          memories that will last the rest of my time on this Earth. Every
          tailgate and every retreat, every formal and every meeting. Each one
          has made me better than the day before. To be chosen by my best
          friends to continue that mission for other young engineers is the
          single greatest honor of my life.
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp;To be the best, we have to take the best natural born
          leaders that Dwight Look has to offer. If you think you have what it
          takes, please check out our admissions tab above. We'd love to get to
          know you.
